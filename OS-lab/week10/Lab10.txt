Lab 10:  Workflows: Parallel searching

Input: N- Arrays of different sets of integers (either user supplied or randomly generated),   N random query integers -one for each array

Output: Locations of each integer in each array  (if found).

Task: 
1. Searching is always preceded by sorting.
2. Create a single thread to sort each array.
3. The thread signals a searching thread that will begin searching for the corresponding query integer.
4. The sorting thread can go back to sorting other arrays after the signaling.5
. The output of searching thread can be immediately shown after the search is complete.
